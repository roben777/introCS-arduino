Laboratory manual for an introductory course to Computer Science using Arduino projects

Robert Benkoczi (roben777@gmail.com)

This manual accompanies the lab activities for an Introduction to Computer Science, offered at the University of Lethbridge, Canada. Students will learn to make simple projects using the Arduino micro-controller. The first part of this manual concentrates on four basic functions of a micro-controller: reading digital and analog signals, and generating digital and analog signals. Then, in Part 2, the students will start working on a larger project that involves controlling the movement of a simple three wheel robotic gadget and making it autonomous to some degree. 

Students who complete the activities in this manual will have a basic understanding of how to program an Arduino micro-controller and will posses some elemental knowledge concerning simple electronic components such as resistors, light emitting diodes, various sensors, and direct current motors. They will be ready to learn about other, more advanced electronic components and how
to build their own projects.
